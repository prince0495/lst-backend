Try everything on devnet, i.e. connect your solana wallet to devnet.

Send me your minted token to me by your wallet or if you don't have token you can create them free of cost on devnet for trail. And you can directly try it with my token lauchpad:

When you done creating your tokens, just send some amount to me at my wallet address:
`9MTRojsL1QM5AvFBq4kehHLy2V2LmQTnJYuVfbkicRA7`

I will stake your tokens and return my equivalent amount of PARASOL (POL) to your wallet automatically which you can use for anything(trading or holding assets or swapping or investing in liquidity pools) or just give me back and I will automatically return you your respective tokens.

It's not productions ready intentionally so that beginners can grasp knowledge and get familiar with the LST (Liquid Staking Token) idea and implement their production ready awesome projects.
If you liked it give me a star or If you gonna implement it by yourself in better way then just tag me their or give reference to my repo.

Hope you liked it, you guys are awesome.
